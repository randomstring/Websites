<h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>
Bottlecount.com respects and protects the privacy of the individuals that
use Bottlecount.com's services ("Bottlecount.com Services"). Individually
identifiable information about you is not willfully disclosed to any
third party without first receiving your permission, as explained in
this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy").
<p>
<h4>Bottlecount.com and Cookies</h4>
<p>
Upon your first visit to Bottlecount.com, Bottlecount.com sends a "cookie" to your
computer. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique
user. Bottlecount.com uses cookies to grant access to authenticated (logged in) users.
Bottlecount.com will not disclose its
cookies to third parties except as required by a valid legal process
such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.
<p>
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset
your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is
being sent. Be aware, however, that some parts of the Bottlecount.com
Services may not function properly if you refuse cookies.
<p>
<h4>What Information Do We Collect?</h4>
<p>

Bottlecount.com does not collect any unique information about you (such as
your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and
knowingly provide such information. Bottlecount.com notes and saves
information such as time of day, browser type, browser language, and
IP address with each query. That information is used to verify our
records and to provide more relevant services to users. For example,
Bottlecount.com may use your IP address or browser language to determine
which language to use when showing search results or advertisements.
<p>
<h4>Links to Other Sites </h4>
<p>
The stories/sites displayed and/or linked to by the Bottlecount.com Service
are developed by people over whom Bottlecount.com exercises no
control. Other links are also on sites not controlled by
Bottlecount.com. These other sites may send their own cookies to users,
collect data, or solicit personal information. Bottlecount.com may choose to
exhibit its results in the form of a "URL redirecter." When Bottlecount.com
uses a URL redirecter, if you click on a URL on a Bottlecount.com page,
information about the click is sent to Bottlecount.com, and Bottlecount.com in
turn sends you to the site you clicked on. Bottlecount.com uses this URL
information to understand and improve the quality of Bottlecount.com's
technology.
<p>
<h4>With Whom Does Bottlecount.com Share Information?</h4>
<p>
Bottlecount.com may share information about you with advertisers, business
partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only divulge
aggregate information about our users and will not share personally
identifiable information with any third party without your express
consent. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average
Bottlecount.com user visits Bottlecount.com, or which Bottlecount.com pages are most
often used. Please be aware, however, that we will release specific
personal information about you if required to do so in order to comply
with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena,
statute, or court order.
<p>
<h4>Your consent and changes to the Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>
By using the Bottlecount.com Services and our web site, you consent to the
collection and use of your information as we have outlined in this
policy and to our <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Service Policy.</a>

Bottlecount.com may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to
time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page so that you
are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and
under what circumstances we disclose it.
<p>
<h4>Who can I ask if I have additional questions?</h4>
<p>
Feel free to contact us any time and we'll answer any additional
questions you may have. Our email address is staff &#064; bottlecount &#046; com.
