<h4>Trademark Compliance</h4>
<p>
As a provider of space for advertisements, please note that Bottlecount.com
is not in a position to arbitrate trademark disputes between the
advertisers and trademark owners. As stated in our Terms and
Conditions, the advertisers themselves are responsible for the ad text
that they choose to use. Accordingly, we encourage trademark owners to
resolve their disputes directly with the advertisers, particularly
because the advertisers may have similar advertisements on other
sites.
<p>
If you are a trademark owner (or represent a trademark owner) and have
an objection to an advertiser's use of your trademark in ad text that
is consistent with the foregoing, please provide the following
information in a signed letter on company stationary:
<ol>
<li>Name of Company
<li>Contact information (including email address)
<li>List of trademark(s) at issue and the country/countries in which it is registered
<li>The identity of the advertisement(s) at issue (via the URL stated on the bottom line of the ad)
<li>The content in the advertisement that concerns you.

<li>If your site has an affiliate program, are affiliates permitted to use the trademark in the advertisement's content?
<li> Include the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that
use of the trademarks described above with the advertisements
described above is not authorized by the trademark owner or its agent,
nor is such use otherwise permissible under law."
<li>Include the following statement: "I represent that the information in this notification is true and correct and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the trademark owner."
<li>Your signature.
</ol>
Please send this written communication with the above information to the address on our <a href="/contact.html">contact page.</a>
<p>
Please Note: The foregoing procedure applies only to the use of
trademarks in advertisements, which are clearly marked as
advertisement on our pages. We do not take action on objections to the
use of trademarks in site to which we link. For any such objections,
please contact the site owner directly.
