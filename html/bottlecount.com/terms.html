<ol>
<li>Priority. This Agreement, in combination with Bottlecount.com's Privacy Policy (available at http://www.bottlecount.com/privacy.html), sets forth the terms and conditions under which Bottlecount.com makes the Service available to you. In the event of an inconsistency between this Agreement and Bottlecount.com's Privacy Policy, this Agreement shall control. </li>

You may only display the content of the Service for your own personal use (i.e., non-commercial use) and may not otherwise copy, reproduce, alter, modify, create derivative works, or publicly display any content. For example, you may not do any of the following: use the Service to sell a product or service; use the Service to increase traffic to your Web site for commercial reasons, such as advertising sales; take the results from the Service and reformat and display them, or mirror any portion of the results on your Web site; or use the Service as part of a "meta-search" offering.

In this regard, you understand that Bottlecount.com does not monitor or control the content of information posted by others, and instead simply provides a service by allowing users to access information that has been made available. Because Bottlecount.com does not control the Content posted via the Service, Bottlecount.com does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content.

SOME STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE AND JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.</p>
</li>
<li>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL TOPIX.NET OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO ANY USER ON ACCOUNT OF THAT USER'S USE OR MISUSE OF OR RELIANCE ON THE SERVICE ARISING FROM ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF. SUCH LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO PREVENT RECOVERY OF DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHETHER SUCH CLAIM IS BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, (EVEN IF TOPIX.NET OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES).

</li>
<li>Requests for Removal of Links or Cached Materials. Bottlecount.com occasionally receives requests from people to remove links from its indices. Although Bottlecount.com reserves the right to address such requests individually, the general approach that Bottlecount.com takes reflects the following principles:
<p>Bottlecount.com's indices consist of information that has been identified, indexed and compiled through an automated process with no advance review by human beings. Given the enormous volume of web site information added, deleted, and changed on a frequent basis, Bottlecount.com cannot and does not screen anything made available through its indices. For each web site reflected in Bottlecount.com's indices, if either (i) a site owner restricts access to his or her web site or (ii) a site is taken down from the web, then, upon receipt of a request by the site owner or a third party in the second instance, Bottlecount.com would consider on a case-by-case basis requests to remove the link to that site from its indices. However, if the operator of the site does not take steps to prevent it, the automatic facilities used to create the indices are likely to find that site and index it again in a relatively short amount of time.</p>
</li>
<li>Hold Harmless and Indemnity. You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Bottlecount.com, and its employees, agents and representatives, from and against any third party claim arising from or in any way related to your use of the Service, including any without limitation any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of Content you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Service, your use of the Service, your connection to the Service, your violation of this Agreement, or your violation of any rights of another. The foregoing includes, without limitation, indemnity for any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys' fees, of every kind and nature. In such a case, Bottlecount.com will provide you with written notice of such claim, suit or action.</li>

<li>Release and Waiver. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby release, and waive all claims against Bottlecount.com and its employees and agents from any and all liability for claims, damages (actual and consequential), costs and expenses (including litigation costs and attorneys' fees) of every kind and nature, arising out of or in any way connected with use of the Service. If you are a California resident, you waive your rights under California Civil  1542, which states, "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." Residents of other states and nations similarly waive their rights under applicable and/or analogous laws, statutes, or regulations.</li>
<li>Modifications of Terms. Bottlecount.com shall have the right to modify the terms of this Agreement at any time, which modification shall be effective immediately upon posting. Accordingly, we suggest that you check this page periodically. To make your review more convenient, we will post a version number or date at the bottom of this page.</li>

<p>The RSS feeds and the Iframe syndication are provided free of charge for use by individuals and non-profit organizations for personal, non-commercial uses. In both cases, we require that you provide attribution to Bottlecount.com. In connection with the RSS feed, if you provide this attribution in text, please use: "News on [name of page] from Bottlecount.com" and a hyperlink to the Bottlecount.com source page.

We are also including the provider of each individual news story in the feed alongside each headline, along with a hyperlink to that site. Please do not alter this for display. We want our news providers to be not only attributed for their work but also receive the traffic from those interested in reading a particular story. Bottlecount.com also reserves the right to require you to cease utilizing either the RSS feed and/or the Iframe at any time for any reason.</p>
</li>

<li>Miscellaneous. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed superseded by a valid enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. Bottlecount.com's failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive Bottlecount.com's right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. The failure of Bottlecount.com to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms and conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The section headings and subheadings contained in this Agreement are included for convenience only, and shall not limit or otherwise affect the terms of this Agreement. This agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California as if made in California by two residents of that state. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any such controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and unappealable. The arbitration shall be conducted in Palo Alto, California and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Bottlecount.com may at any time seek injunctions or other forms of equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any provision hereof, for all purposes of this Agreement each party shall be and act as an independent contractor and not as partner, joint venture, agent, employee or employer of the other and shall not bind nor attempt to bind the other to any contract. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Bottlecount.com and you with respect to the subject matter hereof. You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to this agreement.</li>
