 </p>
      <p> The Oil Filter Housing that is on the M coupe is the identical
looking housing as the one that came with the LTW as part of the Oil Cooler
Kit.  Identical looking yes, functional no (not out of the box), the one
on the M coupe is not machined to accept the thermostat that's with the LTW
kit, in fact the thermostat is inside the Oil Filter Housing, there is no
BMW part number for the thermostat, if it goes bad you have to order the
whole Oil Filter Housing. </p>
      <p> The unused hole on the M coupe Oil Filter Housing has the same
pressure of oil present as the other three holes.  If an External Oil Thermostat
and Oil Cooler were attached to the M coupe Oil Filter Housing oil would
NOT flow.  A BMW LTW (EURO) Oil Filter Housing will be needed to control
the flow of oil.  Using Aeroquip style lines and fittings to a oil cooler
will require that the BMW LTW (EURO) Oil Filter Housing to have the two holes
on the side tapped to either 3/8" NTP or 14x1.50mm.  If a 14x1.50mm tap is
available, on the back side of the housing the hole closes to the block needs
to be enlarge from 12mm to 14x1.50mm, to accept the VANOS line, if not use
a Male Metric x Male AN union, 12x1.5 x -6 AN fitting.           </p>
      <p> Below is the parts list for this project.  Please read <a href="discpyrt.htm#Copyright/Disclaimer">

 before continuing.  There are more than one manufacture for some of the
items listed below, Mocal, Aeroquip and Earl's seem to be the major players.
 -8 AN hose was selected for the oil lines running from the oil housing to
the oil cooler.  -6 AN hose was selected for the replacement Vanos line.
 Vanos line is being moved to the back of the oil housing to free up the
opening on the side of the housing to allow the lines coming from the oil
cooler to attach.  If the oil cooler is not available in -8 AN then use a
-10 AN and then get -10 to -8 AN reducers.  There is more than one way this
could be done.   </p>
      <p> <strong>Parts</strong><br>
 To start off with BMW LTW (EURO) Oil Filter Housing. </p>
      <ul>
 <li>11 42 1 404 206  -  BMW LTW (EURO) Oil Filter Housing </li>
      </ul>
  
      <p> The following is a list of parts needed to attach an oil cooler
to the BMW LTW (EURO) Oil Filter Housing after it has been tapped for either
14x1.5mm or 3/8 NPT, see above.  </p>
      <ul>
 <li>(1) 16 or 19 Row Oil Cooler, -8 AN fittings </li>
        <li>(2) 90 degree Elbow -8 AN fitting (used on oil cooler) </li>
        <li>(2) 45 degree Elbow -8 AN fitting (used on oil housing) </li>
        <li>(2) Male Metric x Male AN union, 14x1.5mm x -8 AN (used on oil
housing, if not using 3/8' NPT union) </li>
        <li>(2) 3/8" NPT x -8 AN union (used on oil housing, if not using
14x1.5mm union) </li>
        <li>12 feet or so of -8 AN Aeroquip type hose </li>
        <li>1" x 1/8" x 30" or so Aluminum (used to mount oil cooler) </li>
        <li>1/4" diameter bolts and lock nuts (to mount cooler) </li>
        <li>Quick-Mount Kit (used also to mount oil cooler) </li>
        <li>(2) rubber grommets, 3/4"ID with 1/8" wide grove (protect Aeroquip
type hose) </li>
      </ul>
 
      <p> The following is the list of parts needed to replace the Vanos
lines when a 14x1.50mm tap is not available. </p>
      <ul>
 <li>(1) 90 degree Elbow -6 AN fitting (used to replace Vanos line) </li>
        <li>(1) 150 degree Elbow -6 AN fitting (used to replace Vanos line) 
        </li>
        <li>(1) Male Metric x Male AN union, 12x1.5 x -6 AN (used to replace
Vanos line) </li>
        <li>(1) Male Metric x Male AN union, 14x1.5 x -6 AN (used to replace
Vanos line) </li>
        <li>2 feet or so of -6 AN Aeroquip type hose (used to replace Vanos
line) </li>
      </ul>
 
      <p> To combine the oil present and oil temp sensors into one oil housing
hole, the following is needed: </p>
      <ul>
 <li>JTD Oil Distribution (T-block) </li>
      </ul>
  
      <p> <strong>Parts Cost  -   $729.00 </strong><br>
 $380.00 - BMW LTW (EURO) Oil Filter Housing<br>
 $110.00 - Oil Cooler<br>
 $199.00 - Fittings and hoses<br>
 $   90.00 - JTD Oil Distribution (T-block)<br>
   $   50.00 - AN Vice Jaws and Wrenches<br>
 $   10.00 - Mounting supplies / hardware<br>
 </p>
      <p> Note part cost does not include installation.  I spent the better
part of a weekend day making up the hoses and mounting the oil cooler in
the front bumper.  I then had the dealer install the BMW LTW (EURO) Oil Filter
Housing and connect the hoses, a good solid 5 hours.  </p>
      <p> <strong>Results</strong><br>
 On the 5 hour drive to and from Mid-Ohio Race Track, the oil temp was running
around 200-210F. During the 1 hour Enduro race, the oil temp indicator was
straight up, 230-240F. This is a great improvement over the 260-290F previously
seen on the track.   </p>
