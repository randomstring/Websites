=============== 

Todo List:

+ get cardboard bike box [Both]
+ get GSM phone
+ reserve two bike bags w/ Graham [Kevin]
+ double check full payment w/ Graham [Kevin]
+ alert Graham to the fact that we will not be traveling via Bus
  back to Paris, but would rather be dropped off at a nearby airport
  or trainstation where we can rent a car. The cities of Pau 
  and Tarbes are very close to where we'll be staying, both 
  have airports (and presumably train stations). [Kevin]
+ reserve car for arrival [Bryn]
+ reserve car for Pyrannies to Paris [Bryn]
+ dinner reservations in Paris [Bryn]
+ reserve hotel in paris, arrival (B) and departure (K&B) [Bryn]
- choose where to stay on French coast & Bordeaux
- choose some destinations in Bordeax, what wineries give tours
  and are friendly to tourists and tasters. 
- research shipping wine back to the US (limit of two bottles per 
  person on the plane. Then its a hefty tarif.)
