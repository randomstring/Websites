<p><b>Leslie R. Dole, Ph.D., CM</b></p>

<p>Les Dole has leadership experience in large national and international programs that have 
embraced a wide range of technical goals and political agendas.</p>

<p>Dole has a comprehensive background in radioactive and hazardous waste management projects, 
including the deep geological disposal of high-level wastes and spent fuel. From 1976 to 1980, 
as a Program Manager in the National Waste Terminal Storage (NWTS) Program Office of Waste 
Isolation (OWI) at Oak Ridge, Dole managed projects for data collection on nuclide transport 
and engineering barriers. These studies supported the risk analyses of deep geological 
repositories for high-level nuclear wastes and spent fuel. </p>

<p>When this program office changed contractors to Battelle, Dole continued to serve the 
NWTS program as the liaison, exchange scientist with programs in the Federal Republic of 
Germany. Developing over 20 cooperative research projects under the bilateral agreement 
between the U.S. DOE and State Department with the Bundesministerium fur Forschung und 
Technologie (BMFT), he coordinated international research in these areas: (1) in situ 
testing of waste packages (Asse mine, Remmlingen), (2) site exploration (PTB, Gorleben), 
(3) waste form formulation and testing (University Clausthal and Karlsruhe, 
Kernforschungszentrum), and (4) risk assessment (Hahn Meitner, Berlin). Dole reads and 
speaks German. In subsequent years, Dole served as technical liaison on the treatment and 
disposal of transuranic wastes between the U.S. And the united Kingdom, France, and the 
UNO International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna, Austria.</p>

 <p>At ORNL, Dole served as a program manager in the Mixed Waste 
 Integrated Programs (MWIP). He lead in the establishment of national programs across 
 the complex to treat and dispose of mixed wastes. As a program manager, Dole developed 
 and administered national technology development programs to apply emerging technologies 
 to mixed-waste streams across the DOE complex. He directed the MWIP activities related to 
 the DOE's compliance with the Federal Facility Compliance Act (FFCAct) and was the 
 programmatic liaison to the Options Analysis Team (OAT) of EM-30's FFCAct Task Force. He 
 was a principal in organizing and directing the EM-30/40/50 Technology Resource Team (TRT) 
 that coordinated the pool of technical resources from across the DOE's national laboratories 
 and operating facilities.</p>

<p>Also at ORNL, Dole managed the multi-site vitrification program for the Transportable 
Vitrification System (TVS) Demonstration program at the Oak Ridge K-25 Plant. He coordinated 
the Westinghouse Savannah River development and Oak Ridge implementation of this emerging 
technology.  To ensure its compliance with the Federal Facility Compliance Act (FFCAct), 
this program implemented a full scale operation/demonstration of the transportable joule 
heated melter at the K-31 area of the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) with mixed low-level 
radioactive wastes from across the DOE complex.</p>	

<p>While at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Dole led the Waste Immobilization Technologies 
(WIT) group in the Chemistry Technology Division (CTD). He developed this group into a 
major new area in CTD, and this group developed and tested new ways to treat, immobilize, 
and package nuclear wastes. The group made waste forms, measuring their leaching, thermal 
and radiolytic stability, physical properties, and durability. In March 1986, Dole helped 
to form the Waste Management Technology Center (WMTC). He was responsible for the program 
management of on-site  environmental demonstrations under Martin Marietta Energy Systems, 
Inc. (MMES), who managed the site for the U.S. Department of Energy (US-DOE) Oak Ridge 
Operations Office (ORO). </p>

<p>With the permission of DOE , Dole consulted on other on-site and in situ remediation of 
superfund and other hazardous waste site clean-ups. Dole was an independent consultant in 
the areas of near-field contaminant transport and waste form treatability studies for 
solidification/stabilization (S/S) technologies. His consulting has resulted in the 
successful disposal of over 20,000,000 curies of radioactive wastes by the Department 
of Energy and the closure of three Superfund sites for the U.S. EPA and for private 
clients, resulted in the solidification/stabilization of over 500,000 tons of hazardous 
wastes. </p>

<p> As a result of a very successful site closure for them, Florida Power & Light (FPL Group), 
 Inc. formed QUALTEC, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary to pursue the remediation business. Dole 
 became the Technical Director of QUALTEC, directing over 300 treatability studies in 
 their  Oak Ridge and Knoxville laboratories. Dole played a key role in the business 
 development  and marketing of this company. After joining the organization in 1988, its 
 revenues rose  from $8M to over $50M per year within the following three years. QUALTEC 
 became EPA  contractor of the year in 1990, and its technology was  pre-qualified for all 
 CERCLA  sites by the EPA in 1991. </p>
 
<p>Dole has been an expert witness in major environmental litigation, providing technical 
direction and testimony essential to winning cases. He has also conducted workshops on in situ 
and ex-situ solidification/stabilization (S/S) technologies for the University of Wisconsin and 
the American Groundwater Association.

<P>He has served as a lead investigator for the federal&nbsp; Chemical
Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, investigating major accidents in 
petroleum, 
<a href="SonatFinal.pdf" name="SonatFinal.pdf"> 
(<i>SonatFinal.pdf</i>)</a> and specialty chemicals industries 
<a href="MortonFinal.pdf" 
name="MortonFinal.pdf"> (<i>MortonFinal.pdf</i>) </a>. 

<P>Dole has a Q security clearance with OSHA HAZWOPER, Hazardous Waste
Supervisor, and Radiation Worker Level II certifications. He is a Certified Manager 
by the National Management Association. </p>

<p>He has authored over 115 papers, chapters, and reports.</p>

<P>Les Dole received his <B>Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry from Virginia Polytechnic
Institute</B> and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia in 1972 and his
<B>M.S. from Lehigh University</B>, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in 1968. The
former thesis dealt with water treatment, the adsorption of aromatic solutes
from aqueous solutions onto hydrophobic surfaces. The latter thesis showed
the colloidal and surface properties of hydrogels resulting from the treatment
of papermill effluents.

<P>From 1971 to 1976, Dole studied <B>nuclide transport in pressurized
water reactor systems</B> for the Westinghouse Power Systems Division (W-PSD).
He developed low-level samplers, control systems, and transport models
for iodine-131. At W-PSD, he also studied aqueous phosphate chemistry and
steam generator corrosion near the critical point of water.

<P>From 1976 to 1980 as a <B>Program Manager in the National Waste Terminal
Storage Program</B> at Oak Ridge, Dole managed the data collection on nuclide
transport and engineering barriers. These studies supported the risk analyses
of deep geological repositories for high-level nuclear wastes. When this
program office changed contractors, Dole continued to serve the program
as the liaison to programs in the Federal Republic of Germany. He coordinated
international research in these areas: (1) in situ testing of waste packages
(Asse mine, Remmlingen), (2) site exploration (PTB, Gorleben), (3) waste
form formulation and testing (University Clausthal and Karlsruhe, Kernforschungszentrum),
and (4) risk assessment (Hahn Meitner, Berlin). Dole reads and speaks German.

<P>From 1980 to 1986, Dole led the <B>Waste Immobilization Technologies
(WIT)</B> group in the Chemistry Technology Division (CTD) of the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory. He developed this group into a major new area in CTD.
The group developed and tested new ways to treat, immobilize, and package
nuclear wastes. The group made waste forms, measuring their leaching, thermal
and radiolytic stability, physical properties, and durability.

<P>In March 1986, Dole helped to form the <B>Waste Management Technology
Center (WMTC)</B>. He was responsible for the program management of on-site
environmental demonstrations under Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc.
(MMES). MMES manages the site for the U.S. Department of Energy (US-DOE)
Oak Ridge Operations Office (ORO).

<P>With the approval of MMES and US-DOE, Dole consulted in the private
sector on <B>hazardous waste treatment</B>, on-site stabilization, product
evaluation, and processing technologies. For Florida Power &amp; Light
Company, he developed the<B> remedial action and closure</B> of a Pepper's
Steel &amp; Alloys National Priorities List (NPL) "Superfund" site.

<P>Based on the success of this NPL closure, QUAL<B>TEC</B> was formed
by FPL Group. Dole was the <B>Director of Technologies </B>for QUAL<B>TEC</B>,
Inc.'s Oak Ridge and Knoxville laboratories. He has directed over <B>300
treatability studies</B>. Dole participated in the business development
and marketing of this company. QUAL<B>TEC</B> was EPA contractor of the
year in 1990, and its technology was prequalified for all CERCLA sites
by the EPA. Ogden Environmental and Energy Services (OEES) purchased QUAL<B>TEC</B>
in July 1991 and dissolved it in November 1992.

<P>From November 1992 to June 1993, Dr. Dole was a <B>Senior Project Manager
</B>with Ogden Environmental and Energy Services, Inc., in its Oak Ridge,
Tennessee offices. He participated in establishing the first international
Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (<B>CRADA</B>) between Ogden,
ORNL/DOE, and Germany.

<P>In June 1993, Dole became an <B>independent consultant</B> in the areas
of near-field contaminant transport and waste form treatability studies
for solidification/stabilization (<B>S/S)</B> technologies. Current clients
include: OHM Remediation Services, OEES, Gulf Coast Recycle, Florida Power
&amp; Light Company, Burlington Environmental, MMES, Gilbert Commonwealth,
DOE/MWIP, Crown Laundry, American Linen, and Akerman, Senterfitt &amp;
Eidison, P.A. He has been an <B>Expert Witness</B> in major environmental
litigation. He also conducts <B>workshops on ex-situ S/S</B> for the University
of Wisconsin and the American Groundwater Association. He has authored
<B>100 papers</B>.

<P>In February 1994, Dole rejoined ORNL CTD as a <B>Senior Staff Scientist</B>,
serving in the national Mixed Waste Integrated Program (MWIP), where he
directed the technical development (TD) programs supporting DOE sites'
compliance with the <B>Federal Facility Compliance Act</B> (FFCAct). He
was a principal organizer and co-leader of the national <B>Technology Resource
Team</B> (TRT), which coordinated technologist from across the DOE Complex
on FFCAct issues. He served as the ORO multi-site coordinator of the <B>Transportable
Vitrification Demonstration</B> at the K-25 site. Dole is currently is
a Senior Development Staff Member of the Engineering Coordination and Analysis
(EC&amp;A) Section of the Chemical Technology Development (CTD) Division
of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) managed by Lockheed Martin
Energy Research (LMER), Inc, for the Oak Ridge Operations (ORO) of the
Department of Energy (US DOE)in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

<P>He was a <B>lead investigator</B> for the federal Chemical
Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, investigating major accidents
in petroleum and specialty chemicals industries.
