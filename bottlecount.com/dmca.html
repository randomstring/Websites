<h4>Digital Millennium Copyright Act</h4>
<p>
It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement that
comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the text of which
can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site,
<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/">http://www.copyright.gov/</a>)
and other applicable intellectual
property laws, which may include removing or disabling access to
material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity. If we
remove or disable access to comply with the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner
or administrator of each affected site so that they may make a counter
notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of that Act. It is
our policy to document all notices of alleged infringement on which we
act. A copy of the notice will be sent to a third party who will make
it available to the public.
<p>
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide a written
communication (by fax or regular mail -- not by email, except by prior
agreement) that sets forth the items specified below. Please note that
you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees)
if you materially misrepresent that a product or activity is
infringing your copyrights. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether
certain material of yours is protected by copyright laws, we suggest
that you first contact an attorney.
<p>
To expedite our ability to process your request, please use the following format (including section numbers):
<ol>
<li> Identify in sufficient detail the copyrighted work that you believe has been infringed.
For example, "The copyrighted work at issue is the text that appears on www.Bottlecount.com/about.html."
<li> Identify the material that you claim is infringing the copyrighted work listed in item #1 above.
<li> Provide information reasonably sufficient to permit Bottlecount.com to contact you (email address is preferred).
<li> Provide information, if possible, sufficient to permit Bottlecount.com to notify the owner/administrator of the web page that allegedly contains infringing material (email address is preferred).
<li> Include the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the allegedly infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law."
<li> Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."
<li> Sign the paper.
</ol>
Send the written communication to the address on our <a href="/contact.html">contact page.</a>
<h4>Counter Notification</h4>
<p>
The administrator of an affected site may make a counter notification
pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act. When we receive a counter notification, we will
reinstate the material in question.
<p>
To file a counter notification with us, you must provide a written
communication (by fax or regular mail -- not by email, except by prior
agreement) that sets forth the items specified below. Please note that
you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees)
if you materially misrepresent that a product or activity is not
infringing the copyrights of others. Accordingly, if you are not sure
whether certain material infringes the copyrights of others, we
suggest that you first contact an attorney. A sample counter
notification may be found at <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca/counter512.pdf">http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca/counter512.pdf.</a>
<p>
To expedite our ability to process your counter notification, please use the following format (including section numbers):

<li> Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that each search result or message identified above was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."
