<LI>Fixing the rear latch: 
<blockquote>One of the little annoyances on
the BMW M Coupe is that the latch on the rear hatch is
under-engineered. (in English: it's <i>crap</i>). After my dealer
replaced 3 broken latches, and failed to install the fix that I had
printed out from the web, I fixed it myself using Ron Stygar's special
made replacement parts.

<LI>Roof rack for transporting track tires:<br>

<blockquote>I purchased a second set of track wheels and tires from <a
href="http://www.trackfreak.com/">Kevin Baillie</a> (AKA Animboy on
the roadfly.org forums). So, I needed a way to transport them to the
track. Mounting them on a roof rack is the route I chose.
</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>I used the official BMW roof rack, which is a great rack
that bolts right on to the roof. Literally: the Z3 Coupe has recessed
bolt holes for the roof rack. I also bought the official BMW small
luggage rack. I strongly advice against the BMW luggage rack, it is a
P.O.S. It's made of flimsy aluminum tubing that is poorly joined. I had
to remove the center cross bar so that the tires wouldn't roll
off. Then I had to reinforce all the remaining bars by lashing them
together with heavy nylon straps and clove hitches. (check your Boy
Scout Handbook on how to tie a clove hitch.)

<LI>Brake rotor replacement:<br>

<b>Oct, 2002</b>

<blockquote> After a couple of track events, I got good enough to
really carry some speed out of the corners and down the
straights. However, I'm not as confident (yet) about carrying all that
speed into the corners. So, as a consequence I'm pretty rough on
brakes. If you think about it, all that BMW M engine horsepower is
getting transformed into heat in the brakes. That's a lot of heat!
</blockquote>
<br>

<blockquote>After paying dearly for one brake rotor swap at Dinan, and
then trashing it at the next track event, I opted to do the next rotor
replacement myself. I opted for slotted frozen rotors and stock
pads. If I had it to do over, I would have bought the Euro floating
rotors and Pagid pads. (Hopefully "next time" won't be too soon!) The
first rotor took about 6 hours because I spent a long time fretting
about torques, not knocking the car off the jack stands, and not
getting brake cleaner all over the rubber gaskets. The second rotor
only took 2 hours. I'm not quite ready to open my own garage yet, but
everything is torqued to spec, works, and no brake squeal!
</blockquote>
<br>
<B>Jan 26, 2003:</B>

<blockquote>Just finished replacing the rear rotors with stock BMW
rotors, as well as new pads. I ordered them from <a href="http://southbmw.com/bmw_car_dealer_part_discount.htm">
South Motors BMW</a> in Miami. Very reasonable prices ($60 each for the
rotors). This time it was a piece of cake compared to the first rotor
swap. About 2 hours total and that included bleeding the rear brakes.

<LI>Track Weekend with TracQuest at Laguna Seca, November 2002.

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.tracquest.com/">TracQuest</a> is a top notch group
that organizes track outings. I've done several track weekends with
the local BMWCCA, which are ideally suited for beginners wanted to learn
the ropes in a very controlled environment. TracQuest is a nice step
up from that, in so far as the environment is a little more accepting
of different lines and experimentation. I learned how to double apex
turn 2, which is a total blast in the M Coupe.

<LI>Track Weekend with <a href="http://www.tracquest.com/">TracQuest</a> at ThunderHill, July 2003.
<blockquote>
Here are some <a href="http://www.atomicwidget.com/cgi-bin/view.cgi?path=photos/2003_July_ThunderHill/">pictures</a> of me driving at ThunderHill. 
The temperatures were &quot;mild&quot; for the Central Valley in July. The temperatures were in the high 90s both days. The previous weekend
the high was 105. I was glad I had the brake ducts installed. I experience no fade from the brakes, although I managed to get the rear
brakes hot enough to get a bit of pad transfer. Maybe I need to ventilate the rears now too. Either that or stick to cooler weather. :)
