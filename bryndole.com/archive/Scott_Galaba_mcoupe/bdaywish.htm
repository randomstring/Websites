      <p> The following was written by my father for my 40th birthday.  The
photo below was drawn by my Uncle also for my 40th.  As a way of saying thanks
to both of them, I'd like to share it with you all.  As many of you know,
it really did happen to me last year. </p>

      <p> Now listen my children and you shall hear of a racer's exploits
who had no fear. </p>
      <p> The news traveled fast about this little known saga at a recent
event by a driver named Galaba. </p>
      <p> It happened one weekend at the Putnam track as Scott's little "M"
car was tearing down the back. </p>
      <p> The first sign of trouble was a rear wobbling wheel and then lots
of noise and the sound of a squeal. </p>
      <p> And shaking and shuttering the drive really got worse but Scott
kept his cool and didn't even curse! </p>
      <p> He said to himself as he spun around and around I'll head for the
infield where there's lots of soft ground. </p>
      <p> So off of the track the racer did go as it started to decelerate
and go very slow. </p>
      <p> When he came to a halt and stared all around he noticed the rear
wheel was lying on the ground. </p>
      <p> He thought and he thought as he wondered to himself could I have
left a few wheel bolts just sitting on the shelf? </p>
      <p> But what actually happened he soon did discover was that the wheel
bolts did shear so he couldn't recover. </p>
      <p> So into the garage his "M" car was taken for he seemed not to worry
though even quite shaken. </p>
      <p> So ready he got for race number two and said to the pack, "I'll
pass lots of you". </p>
      <p> The results of the first race he ended up last but in the second
he'd recover by going real fast. </p>
      <p> At the start of the race he was in back of the pack only because
those wheel bolts had fallen out on the track. </p>
      <p> But he had a good race with the finish in sight when the motor
did cough and it gave him a fright. </p>
      <p> The racer did slow as others did pass and he knew right away he
must be out of gas. </p>
      <p> Then he jumped from his car and ran to the back and he pushed and
he pushed the car down the track. </p>
      <p> And as he pushed across the line he heard the crowd chatter "Fill
up the next time because it really does matter". </p>
      <p> And we heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight "I'll return
another day but for now just a good night". </p>
