      <p> <font size="5">Noises and Rattles in the BMW M coupe</font> </p>
      <p> The following are areas in the BMW M coupe that have been reported
to make noises or rattle by other coupe owners on different Internet digest. 
      </p>
      <p> <strong> AMP / Subwoofer Enclosure</strong><br>
 The plastic enclosure behind the seats has been know to make noises / clanking
sounds.  The problem in the number of different pieces of plastic that make
up the items behind the seats.  A fix to this problem is to disassemble all
of the plastic pieces and to place foam tape between them before screwing
them back together. </p>
      <p> <strong> Fan Noise From Under The Passenger Side Dash</strong><br>
 If you are hearing the sounds of a fan or a sucking sound from under the
passenger side dash this is the sound of air being drawn in from the passenger
compartment my the DME cooling fan in the engine compartment.  At this time
there is no known fix. </p>
      <p> <strong> Luggage Shade</strong><br>
 In the retracted position, the ends of the shade have been reported to rattle
against the amp/subwoofer enclosure.  A fix to this is to place a few small
pieces of self-adhesive foam to the metal ends of the shade. </p>
      <p> <strong> Rear Hatch</strong><br>
 The rear hatch has been know to rattle or make a clicking sound.  If it's
the rattling noise check on the hatch for two rubber adjustment pieces, these
two pieces can be turned to adjust the tension on the hatch in the closed
position.  If its the clicking sound, it's been reported that the pin which
holds the hatch down needs adjusting from factory specifications.  </p>
