      <p> <strong> <a name="doublevanos"> <i> What is Double VANOS?</i></a>
      </strong>  </p>
      <p> First what is a single VANOS?  On most BMW engines that use a single
VANOS, the timing of the intake cam is only changed at two distinct rpm points.
 </p>
      <p> On the double VANOS system for '99 the timing of the intake and
exhaust cams are continuously variable throughout the majority of the rpm
range.  Double VANOS improves low rpm power, flattens the torque curve, and
widens the powerband for a given set of camshafts.  </p>
      <p> When comparing the HP and TQ peaks of a single and double VANOS
2.8 engines, the double VANOS engine has a 450 rpm lower TQ peak and a 200
rpm higher HP peak (a 45% increase in powerband between the peaks) and the
torque curve is improved between 1500 - 3800 rpm and at the same time the
torque does not fall off as fast past the HP peak. </p>
      <p> The benefits in having a double VANOS over a single VANOS, is a
much more tractable, flexible and more powerful engine for everyday use.

      <hr> 
      <p> <strong> <a name="smg"> <i> What is a SMG transmission?</i></a>
      </strong>  </p>
      <p> SMG stands for Sequential Manual Gearbox.  The SMG is a true manual
gearbox with a computer controlled clutch. </p>
      <p> A steptronic type, like in a Porsche, is a true automatic that
can be controlled like a manual.   </p>
      <hr> 
      <p> <strong> <a name="airfilter"> <i> I want my car to make that throaty
sound and was wondering if anyone has added an aftermarket airfilter to their
car?</i></a>
      </strong>  </p>
      <p> To get the sound you are looking for you will need to install a
cone style type air filter. In doing so you need to be aware of both air
turbulence and engine heat in the engine compartment. Without shielding the
filter you will loose HP. You could just replace the stock air filter with
a K&amp;N filter in the stock air box but you do not gain the sound you might
be looking for. The stock air box that comes on our M's has been improved
over the EURO air box that some sell for the M3s. Next you could look into
intake systems (air intake mods and chip). Dinan has one and Jim conforti
is completing one for the M3s (I'm hoping it will work without much mods
on our M's).   </p>
